title: Hybrid system for adverse drug event detection
abstract: In context of the NLP Challenges for Detecting Medication and Adverse Drug
  Events from Electronic Health Records (MADE 1.0) \citep{Yu}, we built a hybrid natural
  language processing system that combined multiple algorithms and resources to identify
  the relationship between mentions of symptoms and drugs. Our system employed a conditional
  random field (CRF) model for named entity recognition (NER) and a random forest
  model for relation extraction (RE). Final performance of each model was evaluated
  separately and then combined on the challengeâ€™s hold-out evaluation set. The micro-averaged
  F1 score was 80.9% for NER, 86.8% for RE, and 59.2% for the final system.
