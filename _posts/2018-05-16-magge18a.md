title: Clinical NER and Relation Extraction using Bi-Char-LSTMs \titlebreak and Random
  Forest Classifiers
abstract: Identifying named entities from electronic health record notes and extracting
  relations between the entities is a crucial task for many applications in clinical
  and public health informatics. In this work, we present an natural language processing
  pipeline consisting of a named entity recognizer for identifying 9 medical named
  entities in clinical notes and a random forests classifier for extracting 7 types
  of relations between the entities.
