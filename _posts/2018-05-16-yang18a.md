title: Detecting Medications and Adverse Drug Events in Clinical Notes Using Recurrent
  Neural Networks
abstract: 'Early detection of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from Electronic Health Records
  (EHRs) is an important, challenging task to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety
  surveillance. The authors present a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based system
  to detect medication name and its attributes (dosage, frequency, route, duration),
  as well as mentions of ADEs, Indications, other signs and symptoms from clinical
  notes. We developed an RNN-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) system implemented
  using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Two NER models, RNN-1 and RNN-2, were developed
  using different training strategies. Both of the two models only utilized pretrained
  word embeddings provided by organizers without any extra feature engineering. The
  RNN-2 model achieved a top 3 performance (F1-score of 0.8233) for sub-task 1, demonstrating
  the efficiency of RNN for clinical NER tasks. '
