title: Knowledge-based Feature Engineering for Detecting Medication and Adverse Drug
  Events from Electronic Health Records
abstract: This paper presents a Conditional Random Field (CRF) learning model integrated
  with a series of knowledge-based feature engineering functions for detecting medication
  and adverse drug events from electronic health records (EHRs). Our experimental
  evaluation shows high performance in terms of the F-score measure (83.4% and 92.5%
  respectively for strict and relax modes) in the detection of medication and clinical
  finding named entities. It also shows promising results (overall 78.8% F-score)
  in the recognition of detailed properties of medication use as well as different
  types of clinical findings mentioned in electronic health records.
