title: Bidirectional LSTM-CRF for Adverse Drug Event Tagging in Electronic
  Health Records
abstract: "Adverse drug event (ADE) detection
  is a vital step towards effective pharmacovigilance and prevention of future incidents
  caused by potentially harmful ADEs. Electronic health
  records (EHRs) of patients in hospitals contain valuable information
  regarding the ADEs and hence are an important source for detecting ADE signals.
  We have developed a deep learning based system that utilizes a three layered deep
  learning architecture of 1) RNN (bi-directional long short-term
  memory (bi-LSTM)) for character-level word representation 2) bi-LSTM
  for context representation and 3) Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for the final
  output prediction, by integrating them into one deep network architecture. Furthermore,
  we have developed customized rule-based tokenization techniques for preprocessing
  text to deal with the noise in the EHR text. In this paper, we share our system
  architecture and its performance w.r.t the MADE1.0 NLP challenge."
