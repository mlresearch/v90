title: 'IBM Research System at MADE 2018: Detecting Adverse Drug Events from Electronic
  Health Records'
abstract: 'Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) are common and occur in approximately 2-5% of
  hospitalized adult patients. Each ADE is estimated to increase healthcare cost by
  more than $3,200. Severe ADEs rank among the top 5 or 6 leading causes of death
  in the United States. Prevention, early detection and mitigation of ADEs could save
  both lives and dollars. Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on
  Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provides an effective way of real-time pharmacovigilance
  and drug safety surveillance. Thus, in this research, we developed a system for
  three different NLP tasks namely: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Identification
  and Integrated task (integrative system to conduct NER and relation identification
  together). Our system achieved F-1 measures of 0.829 for Named Entity Recognition,
  0.840 for Relation Identification and 0.617 for Integrated task. Our system ranked
  1st in the integrated task and 2nd in both entity extraction and relation identification
  tasks.'
