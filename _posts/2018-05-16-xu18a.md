title: UArizona at the MADE1.0 NLP Challenge
abstract: MADE1.0 is a public natural language processing challenge aiming to extract
  medication and adverse drug events from Electronic Health Records. This work presents
  NER and RI systems developed by UArizona team for the MADE1.0 competition. We propose
  a neural NER system for medical named entity recognition using both local and context
  features for each individual word and a simple but effective SVM-based pairwise
  relation classification system for identifying relations between medical entities
  and attributes. Our system achieves 81.56%, 83.18%, and 59.85% F1 score in the three
  tasks of MADE1.0 challenge, respectively, ranked amongst the top three teams for
  Task 2 and 3.
