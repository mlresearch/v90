    abstract = {Early detection of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is an important, challenging task to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance. The authors present a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based system to detect medication name and its attributes (dosage, frequency, route, duration), as well as mentions of ADEs, Indications, other signs and symptoms from clinical notes. We developed an RNN-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) system implemented using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Two NER models, RNN-1 and RNN-2, were developed using different training strategies. Both of the two models only utilized pretrained word embeddings provided by organizers without any extra feature engineering. The RNN-2 model achieved a top 3 performance (F1-score of 0.8233) for sub-task 1, demonstrating the efficiency of RNN for clinical NER tasks. }

    abstract = {Currently, the best performance for Named Entity Recognition in medical notes is obtained by systems based on neural networks. These supervised systems require precise features in order to learn well fitted models from training data, for the purpose of recognizing medical entities like medication and Adverse Drug Events (ADE). Because it is an important issue before training the neural network, we focus our work on building comprehensive word representations (the input of the neural network), using character-based word representations and word representations. The proposed representation improves the performance of the baseline LSTM. However, it does not reach the performances of the top performing contenders in the challenge for detecting medical entities from clinical notes.}

Our system employed a conditional random field (CRF) model for named entity recognition (NER) and a random forest model for relation extraction (RE). Final performance of each model was evaluated separately and then combined on the challenge's hold-out evaluation set. The micro-averaged F1 score was 80.9\% for NER, 86.8\% for RE, and 59.2\% for the final system.}

	pages = {39-47},
	abstract = {Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) are common and occur in approximately 2-5\% of hospitalized adult patients. Each ADE is estimated to increase healthcare cost by more than \$3,200. Severe ADEs rank among the top 5 or 6 leading causes of death in the United States. Prevention, early detection and mitigation of ADEs could save both lives and dollars. Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provides an effective way of real-time pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance. Thus, in this research, we developed a system for three different NLP tasks namely: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Identification and Integrated task (integrative system to conduct NER and relation identification together). Our system achieved F-1 measures of 0.829 for Named Entity Recognition, 0.840 for Relation Identification and 0.617 for Integrated task. Our system ranked 1st in the integrated task and 2nd in both entity extraction and relation identification tasks.}

Furthermore, we have developed customized rule-based tokenization techniques for preprocessing text to deal with the noise in the EHR text. In this paper, we share our system architecture and its performance w.r.t the MADE1.0 NLP challenge.}
